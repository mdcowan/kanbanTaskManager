- [x] Milestone 2:
For the second milestone: adapt static HTML into a dynamic application that pulls data in from an API, establish functions for CRUD operations, and build out the form to handle the CRUD operations.

- [x] Milestone 3:
For the third milestone: focus is on accessibility to ensure your application is accessible to assistive technologies, implement form validation, implement user customization, and connect the form actions to the API.
